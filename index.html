Super Smash Bros: EXO

A Smash Ultimate Overhaul by PhazoGanon

Overview:

Legend:

Green: A change that buffs the character
Red: A change that nerfs the character
Brown: Either a mix of a buff and nerf, or something that (to my knowledge) doesn’t change anything significantly
Blue: An overhaul to how a move or mechanic works
Purple: A planned change or overhaul

Terminology:

Wavedashing/Wavedash: 

A physics engine exploit (in Super Smash Bros Melee), or technique in Super Smash Bros Ultimate, which is performed by airdodging diagonally into the ground. Doing this will cause the character to slide some distance, which depends on your traction.

Edge Canceling:

A technique present in all Smash games, where if you hit the ledge or the end of a platform during a move, all endlag you’d normally receive is canceled.

B Reversing:

A technique that was first introduced in Super Smash Bros Brawl, where you can reverse the facing direction and momentum of a move by flicking the control stick in the opposite direction.

Fallouts Fixed:

Usually means that a move has been given sufficient knockback increases to make it more consistently connect towards the center of the move, and an autolink angle, which tries to pull opponents towards the center of the hitbox. If it’s different, clarification will be given.

Land Canceling:

A technique mainly present in Super Smash Bros Melee, where certain moves would have all of their landing lag canceled if they landed during a portion of the move.

Hitfall/Hitfalling:

A technique that debuted in Rivals of Aether, where during the hitlag of a move, you can fast fall.

Hitflow:

Upon hitting an opponent (and not hitting shield), the rest of the animation will be sped up by a listed multiplier until the end of the move. For example, if you hit Lucario’s Down Tilt, it goes from being active on frame 7 and having an FaF of 20, it now starts on frame 4 and has an FaF of 12.

KO Percent is based on Mario with no DI/ASDI (clarified later on) from the center of FD/ledge of FD

Engine Changes:

Balloon Knockback Lower Threshold (In Hitstun Frames): 30 -> 37
Balloon Knockback Upper Threshold (In Hitstun Frames): 80 -> 70
Multiplier to Velocity/Acceleration to reach end of knockback trajectory: 70 -> 55
Launch Angle Range from Base Angle Param to apply extra deceleration and further reduced hitstun scaling: 45 -> 80
Maximum Grounded Initial Launch Speed: 8.3 -> 75

Edge Canceling now applies to a variety of statuses, which includes the following:

Taunts, Idling, Initial Dashes, Turns, Dash Turns, Item Grabs, Item Tosses, Soft/Hard Landings, Aerial Landing Lag, Special Fall Landing Lag, Airdodge Landing Lag, Ledge Teetering, and several attacks and specials (usually listed)

Maximum Reflects increased to 999
Max Hitlag Frames: 30 -> 60
The Maximum Speed a character can go on the ground: 3.0 -> 5.0
Shorthop Damage Multiplier: 0.8 -> 1.0
Hitstun Multiplier for Bouncing off a wall: 0.8 -> 1.0
Multiplier in Gravity Based Vertical Knockback Boost Formula: 5 -> 0
Ledge Trumped Lag: 28 -> 33
Soft/Hard Landings have been standardized to 4 frames
Damage Removed from the Ledge Intangibility Time Formula
Maximum Ledge Intangibility Based on Airtime Decreased (60 -> 41)
Footstool Intangibility: 4 -> 0
Held Buffer Window: 2 -> 0

Movement Changes:

Frame during initial dash to be able to instantly turn around: 5 -> -1
Amount of frames to accelerate to full initial dash speed: 6 -> 4
Maximum Directional Airdodge Landing Lag: 20 -> 10
You can perform a max length wavedash by holding the control stick horizontally
Jostle no longer applies to most attack and special statuses

You can now drop through platforms during the following statuses: Initial Dashes, Running, Turns, Dash Turns, Ledge Teetering, Crouches, Airdodge Landing Lag, Item Grabs, Item Tosses, and Shield. You can hold the special button to disable the ability to platform drop during Airdodge Landing Lag and Item Pickups.

You can now crouch during the following statuses: Walk, Walk Brake, Dash, Turn Dash, Run, Run Brake, Turn Run, and Turn Run Brake. Said crouching can be done as soon as the status starts.

During most statuses, whenever you jump from the ground to the air, your momentum will be preserved, so for instance, if Captain Falcon jumps from a run, he will continue to move at the same speed in the air as he did on the ground.

In relation to this, all the following params have been adjusted:

Ground to Air Horizontal Momentum Multiplier: Original Value -> 1.0
Maximum Initial Horizontal Air Speed from Grounded Jump: Original Value -> Initial Dash/Run Speed (Whichever ones slower)
Maximum Horizontal Velocity from Jump: Original Value -> Initial Dash/Run Speed (Whichever ones faster)
Maximum Initial Horizontal Air Speed from Aerial Jump: Original Value -> Initial Dash/Run Speed (Whichever ones faster)

These values are the case for most fighters, but will be adjusted depending on a fighter by fighter case.

Characters with floaty jumps can halt their vertical momentum by letting go of jump and doing any aerial. Yoshi, Ness, Mewtwo, Lucas, Kazuya, and Sora are the only ones who can Double Jump Cancel.
While you are airborne and actionable (Or landing an aerial or special), you can double tap the control stick in the opposite direction you’re facing to switch direction. This is only doable once per airtime.

Defense:

Shielding can now be performed out of an initial dash
Shield Max HP: 50 -> 45
Minimum Shield Size: 0.15 -> 1 (Removes Shield Poking)
Minimum Shield Hold Frames to Drop Shield: 3 -> 0
Shield HP Degeneration per Frame: 0.15 -> 0.2
Shield HP Regeneration per Frame: 0.08 -> 0.125
Extra Shield Damage: 1.19 -> 1
Maximum Shield Pushback Speed: 1.3 -> 2.5

Parrying projectiles now reflects them with these multipliers:

Power Multiplier: 0.5x
Speed Multiplier: 1.0x
Life Multiplier: 0.8x

Parry Activation Window from Shield Drop (Measured in Frames): 3 -> 1

Shield Breaking has been overhauled for everyone (aside from Jigglypuff): Instead of having the character jump and fly upwards, then fall down and begin their dizzy animation, they instead enter the crumpled animation, then enter the dizzy animation. Shield Breaking also inflicts special zoom.

Dodge Staling Removed
Spotdodge Canceling Removed

Dodges now have standardized intangibility and FaF:

Dodge Intangibility Duration: 2-15 (Spotdodge), 4-18 (Forward Roll/Back Roll)
Dodge FaF: 29 (Spotdodge), 38 (Forward Roll/Back Roll)

Dodge Canceled Item Throw Frame Increased (2 -> 5)

Canceling a Dodge into an Item Throw will enable a Glide Toss. Glide Tossing effectively transfers the momentum you’d normally move during the roll into sliding actionable momentum.

Airdodge Staling Removed

Airdodge Sling Removed:

Direction Airdodge Pullback Distance: 7 -> 1
Direction Airdodge Pullback Duration: 4 -> 0

Airdodges now have standardized intangibility and FaF:

Airdodge Intangibility Duration: 3-23 (Neutral), 3-33 (Directional)
Airdodge FaF: 50 (Neutral), 70 (Directional)

Airdodges can now be canceled into an item throw from frames 1-5. Doing so enables an aerial glide toss, functioning similar to a grounded glide toss.
Airdodges can now be canceled into a Zair from frames 1-5.

Airdodge Momentum has been completely overhauled: Instead of falling and controlling your drift, you move a short distance, before freezing in place. The freeze starts on frame 18, and ends on frame 34, after which, you'll fall straight down and can begin drifting again.

Maximum DI Angle: 9.74 -> 12
SDI has been completely removed, being replaced with ASDI. ASDI stands for Automatic Smash Directional Influence, which means that for every infliction of hitlag you take, you get teleported a certain distance in the direction you’re holding in. The multiplier is 2.15, and is measured in the smallest training mode units
Tumble can now be fast fallen
Attack Hitstun Cancel Frame: 45 -> 999
Airdodge Hitstun Cancel Frame: 40 -> 999
Tech Input Window (measured in frames): 12 -> 20
Tech Lockout Window (measured in frames): 28 -> 40
Tech Airdodge Lockout Window (measured in frames): 15 -> 1

The way mashing works has been overhauled to now be automatic. Holding down the attack or special button will now automatically mash out of the status. It mashes at an approximate rate of 12 times per second.

Grab:

How much the grab timer should decrease based on inputs: 8 -> 0

(Internally this is known as clatter so I will refer to it as clatter timer)

Dizzy (Shield Break):

Dizzy Clatter Timer: 3 -> 0
Dizzy Base Timer Decreased: 400 -> 300

Sleep:

Sleep Clatter Timer: 8 -> 0

Stun:

Stun Clatter Timer: 5 -> 0

Bury:

Bury Clatter Timer: 3 -> 0

Frozen:

Frozen Clatter Timer: 4 -> 0

Crouch Cancel Multiplier: 0.85 -> 1.0
Bury now gives 33% knockback resistance

Offense:

Maximum Rage KB Multiplier: 1.1 -> 1.0
Phantom Hits have been removed
Jabs can now only be input via a neutral attack input
With the exception of Samus, Dash Attack is cancellable into Up Smash from the start of the move until 1 frame after the attack comes out. Dash Attack can also be canceled into Down Smash (doesn’t exclude Samus). The DACUS/DACDS framedata will be listed with each character.
Regrab Immunity Frames: 60 -> 40
Dash Grab Friction: 1.6 -> 0.5
All Grabboxes now use a single catchbox that can grab grounded and aerial opponents
All standard grabs can pick up light and heavy items
Most fighters now gain a new move or ability by pressing special while in shield. Some examples include Ness's PSI Offense Up, Captain Falcon’s Boost Install, and Mewtwo’s Stored Power.
Most moves in the game now use the POS LR Facing Angle. This means the direction they’re sent depends on if you’re in front of them or behind them.

Game Modes: A vast majority of the game modes that exist in the Custom Smash menu have now been replaced with new gamemodes. Here’s what each gamemode replaces:

Mega Smash -> Fast Smash
Mini Smash -> Slow Smash
Flower Smash -> Turbo Smash
Bunny Smash -> Hitstunless Smash
Tail Smash -> Volleyball Smash
Rocket Belt Smash -> Free Launch Smash
Screw Attack Smash -> One Hit Smash
Back Shield Smash -> Smashketball Smash
Curry Smash -> Inverse Knockback Smash
Reflect Smash -> Traditional Fighter Smash

Fast Smash:

Increases the mobility, fall speed, and various other stats of characters, making them faster paced.

Slow Smash:

Decreases the mobility, fall speed, and various other stats of characters, making them slower paced.

Turbo Smash:

Whenever you hit someone with an attack, the endlag of the move can be instantly canceled, sorta like Ryu/Ken’s Special Canceling, but it can be canceled into any move.

Hitstunless Smash:

Moves no longer have hitstun, so you can now instantly act whenever you’re attacked.

Volleyball Smash:

Instead of knocking each other into the blastzone, you now spawn with a soccerball. Your goal is to knock it to the opponent's side, and if they fail to send it back, they will be KO’d.

Free Launch Smash:

The direction you hold the control stick indicates the direction you will be launched whenever being hit.

One Hit Smash:

Any move that you land will instantly KO the opponent. Anytime you’re hit, you also get instantly KO’d.

Smashketball Smash:

Instead of knocking each other into the blastzone, your goal is to knock your opponent into your hoop (indicated by a windy vortex). Knocking them into this will instantly KO them.

Inverse Knockback Smash:

Moves will now send in the opposite direction they would normally send, so spikes now send upwards, and moves that send forward will knock them behind you.

Traditional Fighter Smash:

A planned mode that makes the game more akin to Traditional Fighting Games. Includes things like auto turnaround, command inputs, stamina mode, etc…

Credit to WuBoytH for the Donkey Kong Barrel Code (https://gamebanana.com/members/1511396)


Grounded Down Special has been changed to Barrel Pull

Upon using it, Donkey Kong will pull out the barrel item and begin to carry it around. Due to this being identical to the barrel item, DK can jump around and move with the barrel in his hands. He can also throw it in one of the 4 cardinal directions.

Donkey Kong can only have one barrel every 15 seconds. If he tries to pull more during cooldown, he will do Down Taunt instead.

Barrels have a 6% chance to explode on contact, which deals 6% to anyone, including Donkey Kong.

Barrels have an increased hurtbox size.

Barrels can be hit back to Donkey Kong, which will do damage to him.


Aerial Down Special has been changed to Megaton Clap

Megaton Clap has Donkey Kong do a massive clap diagonally downwards. This move acts as a command grab, automatically forcing Donkey Kong into the Cargo Throw animation

While Meta Knight performs the initial upward sword strike, instead of performing a second strike, he now fully loops forward and soars forward.

Once the move is over, Meta Knight can now begin to Glide. Gliding has Meta Knight fly forward at a relatively fast pace. This move has similarities to Steve’s Elytra, where you can angle the control stick downwards to descend, and angle it upwards to ascend. Meta Knight cannot turn around during this state.

Glide Params:

Maximum Upward Angle: 80
Maximum Downward Angle: -70
Initial Vertical Speed: 0.75
Initial Gravity Multiplier: 1.0
Initial Horizontal Speed Multiplier: 1.0
Initial Horizontal Speed: 1.7

Maximum Horizontal Speed: 2.2
Minimum Horizontal Speed: 0.7

Maximum Upward Angle Acceleration: 0.55
Maximum Downward Angle Acceleration: 0.75
Maximum Vertical Speed: 7.0
Added Speed when Stick is Neutral: 1.0

As you ascend, Meta Knight will lose speed, and if Meta Knight comes to a halt, he will enter freefall. In addition, landing during the gliding animation will have Meta Knight enter the fallen over pose, which is similar to the tripping state.

Finally, Meta Knight can perform a Glide Attack.

Side Special has been changed to Boost

Boost Stats:

Boost can be canceled into Jump, can be canceled into Dash Attack by holding down on the control stick, and can be canceled into Run if you’re on the ground and hold the control stick to the side after the animation is over.


Boost can also be canceled into any move on hit.
Boost’s speed is determined by your previous speed, with the specifics looking like this:

If your previous speed is less than 2.0, Boosts Speed will be equal to 2.0. If your previous speed is greater than 2.0 but less than 2.55, Boosts Speed will be equal to 1.15x your previous speed. If your previous speed is greater than 2.55, Boost’s Speed will be equal to 3.0

This move will not stop at ledges
Aerial Boost is affected by gravity
Boost travels ~75% of Final Destination
Boost requires being charged up in order to use. Boost requires 25 charge increments to fill up the meter. In order to fill up this meter, you need to hit any normal (this includes Tilts, Dash Attack, Smash Attacks, Aerials, Pummel, and Throws), or Homing Attack.

Due to how rapidly Sonic descends, if you miss offstage, you will careen towards the blastzone.

Landing on-stage will allow Sonic to charge up Grounded Down Special by continuing to mash the special button. This is similar to the Drop Dash feature.

Hitting someone with Bounce Bracelet will make Sonic bounce off of the opponent.

Damage: Depends on how long you’ve fallen for, ranging from 1.0% - 14.0%. Maxes out in power on frame 30.

Senator Armstrong


Introduction

So, whenever you ask the average smash fan who they would give Ganondorf's vanilla moveset to, the most likely answer you'll hear is Black Shadow. However, through doing some research on my own, and the current circumstances with models and the like, I found that Black Shadow doesn't actually fit the archetype of Smash Ganon that well, and for a few reasons. 


First, since Falcon's playstyle is loosely based on F-Zero's Speed, it should make sense that Black Shadow should also do that, however, in F-Zero, Black Shadow is actually faster than Falcon, but he has the downside of being really hard to control, so his playstyle could be described as "Sonic on Ice", which doesn't really fit the same archetype as Smash Ganondorf. However, I did find a character that would fit even better than Black Shadow: Senator Steven Armstrong, from Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. 


Now, let me explain why I find him to be a better candidate. First, as I just mentioned, Black Shadow wouldn't actually play as close to Vanilla Ganon as most people think he would, but, in Armstrong's final battle, he fights like Smash Ganon almost to a tee, using really hard hitting attacks (1/4-1/8th of your health), but they have a long windup. Second, he's a much more unique choice compared to Black Shadow, and given how people seem to prefer Third Party additions over First Party additions, I figured this is a better option. Third, he has a lot of memorable and memeable voice clips that I can use for his voice (even though this is a serious addition). 


So, now that I've given my justifications for having him instead of Black Shadow, let me go over how he's changed from Vanilla Ganondorf.

Alt 1 is Default Armstrong

Alt 2 is a red and brown color scheme based on Monsoon

Alt 3 is a white and gray color scheme based on Raiden

Alt 4 is a Red, White, and Blue color scheme, because Patriotism

(Alts 5-8 are shirtless)

Alt 5 is his shirtless form during the second phase of his boss battle

Alt 6 has him adorn blue Navy pants, because he served in the Navy

Alt 7 is mostly identical to Alt 5, but his skin has been turned into Nanomachines

Alt 8 has him adorn beige green pants and white hair, in reference to Liquid Ocelot

Up Taunt has him pose his fist triumphantly while exclaiming 
“Making the Mother of All Omelets”

Side Taunt has him pull his left arm outwards while saying
“Nanomachines Son”

(Based on this scene)


Down Taunt has him stand straight up, almost completely stops moving, and anticipates the opponent to attack them. This taunt can be looped, and it gains both Super Armor and Ungrabbability; however, canceling the taunt after being hit will cause Armstrong to automatically enter Side Taunt.

(Based on this scene)



Stats


Armstrong has two passive mechanics that both enhance his survivability and increase his threat range. Instadrop, and Crouch Canceling.

Whenever fast falling, Armstrong's body generates a hitbox. Said hitbox deals 1%. In addition, Armstrong's gravity increases triplefold whenever fast falling.

Whenever Armstrong fully crouches down, he now only takes 77% knockback from any attack.

Grounded Moves

Armstrong has a mechanic related to all of his grounded attacks. 

While Armstrong is performing the move, he gains a various amount of damage based armor, depending on the speed of the move. In addition, Armstrong only takes 35% knockback during the attack. 

In addition, any time Armstrong's limbs contact the ground during an attack, it will create a disjointed shockwave. Said shockwave deals half the damage of the normal attack.
